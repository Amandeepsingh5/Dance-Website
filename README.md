# Dance-Website Using Full Stack Development (HTML, CSS, Pug, Node.js and MongoDB)

How to Open the Website in Visual Studio Code:

For the Website to be functional we need MongoDB and Express.js to be installed on our system:

1: Download the Zip File from Github.
2: Open the Code in Visual Studio Code.
3: Open the Terminal and run node app.js
4: If you want to see what is stored in the database we can install MongoDB Compass(We can perform All the CRUD operations there)
5: Or if we don't want to install MongoDB Compass we can perform all the CRUD operation using the Visual Studio Code Terminal.
